      <p>This is my Bio. I like long walks on the beach...Oh wait, this is no dating profile. My bad. Well, I was born in Valparaiso, Indiana on June 5th, 1994. I was raised in Clifton, NJ for most of my life. I went to school at the New Jersey Institute of Technology studying Civil Engineering and graduated in December 2016. I decided to go into Data Science about a year into working as an Engineer, so I applied at the Data Analysis Program at UC Berekely. Mostly, I've been busy trying to learn different programing languages such as Python and its various modules: Pandas, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy, Tweepy. Along with SQL/MySQL, Microsoft Excel. I have interests in Sports such as Basketball and Football, I love making videos, reading, learning new things, and looking to perfect my craft. </p>
